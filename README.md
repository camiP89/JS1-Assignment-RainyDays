# JS1-Assignment-RainyDays
Course assignment for an Interactive online store selling Jackets. 

# Goal 
Using your new skills writing JavaScript, create an interactive online store to display
product from an API endpoint. Use one of the three provided API URLs to display
products in HTML and allow users to create a basket of items.
You may use your existing cross course project code as a starting point or start a
fresh project if this is not available. We recommend using an existing project as
styling will not be graded, but is nice to have in the final submission
